# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

The motivation for completeing this project was to complete all three lessons of the pre-work assignment. I built this project to learn HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I learned the basis of each language, and solved issues as I went along using trial and error to complete each step in creating the webpage.
